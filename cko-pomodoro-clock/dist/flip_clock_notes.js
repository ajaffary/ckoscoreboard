// flip clock notes

/*
- create element with id=timer
    - this is the flipclock
    - this element can go inside the scoreboard banner
        - potentially within an iframe?
            - need to change background to none if using an iframe

- find a way to trigger start/stop buttons with a message event
    - start/stop buttons are in the same page as clock
    - they activate anonymous functions with onclick events
        that reference the clock ID in the same HTML file 
    - recreate these functions with separate names (done)
    - try to run them in the console (done)
